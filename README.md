## Code Explanation:-
The code simulates an ATM interface in Java. It consists of a `BankAccount` class with methods to deposit, withdraw, and check the balance, while the `ATM` class handles user interaction through a menu. The user can deposit money, withdraw funds (if sufficient), or check the current balance. The `ATMInterface` class initializes the account with a starting balance of Rs.1000 and creates an `ATM` object to manage the account. The program runs in a loop until the user selects the "Exit" option. It ensures valid inputs for transactions and displays relevant messages based on actions.
